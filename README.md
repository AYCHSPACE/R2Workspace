# Readium NG Workspace
This is a meta-project for bootstrapping together Readium NG projects and Readium 2 dependent projects.

## Requirements
- SSH Key-based authentication working with Git and Github.
- Yarn
- Node 10+

## Set up
1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn`
    - This may take a while longer than expected since it will be cloning other repositories into the root folder.
3. Use commands such as:
    - `yarn build` Build all projects.
    - `yarn watch` Watch mode build.
    - `yarn start` Watch and run dev server.
